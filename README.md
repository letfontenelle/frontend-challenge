## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned / Continued development

This project is my first ever project with frontend and a way to put
my knowledge in practice. 
I learned a lot of the fundamentals of CSS,
but I'm struggling with mastering Box Model.

I think this is the best way to start programming: practicing, even when you
don't have the best/perfect knowledge.

I don't have too much to discuss since this is very new to me and I'll
start more projects soon :)
